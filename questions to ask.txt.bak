enable_local_mode_training = False
 !/bin/bash ./local_mode_setup.sh
 in pytorch example, they were mentioning about organizing and modularizing custom jobs, models and inference process, 
 train and test is happening in underlying model and then estimator.fit is taking train and test as inputs, why?





points:
how is input_fn called?, what is the flow behind it, i tried to call using predict object of generated estimator, no luck
my model is working fine with normal predict approach?
we are passing ndarray, but it is throwing "sagemaker_containers._errors.ClientError: Expected 2D array, got scalar array instead"
