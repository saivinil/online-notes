you can use the a advanced search option (https://www.google.co.in/advanced_search) google offers if you are having trouble finding results here which might potentially have the all options discussed below this

for any google search you will have an option of tools on the results page, when you clock on it, you will be provided with various options based on the type of search, ex: results between a particular time, or use verbatim or get videos with length of particular range

when you are trying to search for a file of particular version either to have a look at it or to download it, you can use the filetype keyword
ex: atomic habits filetype:pdf - will search for pdf related to atomic habits

using - to exclude a word from the possible search results of your search, similarly to include particular word, use + sign (highly useful)
ex: interesting books -rings : will exclude the results which have exact rings word in it

when you search using a group of words, google might return you results which have those words but there is no rule that the order should also be preserved, to search using exact order of words, include search terms between double quotes (highly useful)
ex: "ImportError: cannot import name 'bigquery' from 'google.cloud'" will result search queries with the words mentioned in exact order

if you want to get a specific word in a TITLE or in an URL (highly useful):
ex: intitle:margot will return all urls with margot in its title
ex: inurl:margot will return all urls with margot in its urls
	if your title or url has more than onw word to be included use allintitle:
	ex: allintitle:margot robbie tom holland
	ex: allinurl:sci kit learn medium


if you are missing few words for your google search, then you can use the "around (count of words missing)" in the place of search phrase, you can get some good results (found it useful)
ex: kabhi kushi around (2) cast - this will return the cast list of kabhi kushi kabi ghum movie 

if you miss one word or number you can place an asterisk "*" in between (useful but not much)
ex: "may the * be with you" 

articles or search results from a particular website:
let's say you need a particular article which you read a long time back and want to share it with your office colleagues, or you need to search for a product from a particular website, then you can give the website followed by the search phrase, THIS IS ALSO PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT A PARTICULAR TOPIC AND A PARTICULAR WEBSITE HAS LOTS OF ARTICLES RELATED TO IT(CHECKOUT THE BELOW MEDIUM SCI-KIT LEARN EXAMPLE).(found it useful)
ex: site:www.amazon.in coffe mug 
site:https://medium.com scikit learn
site:.edu scikit learn THIS SEARCH WILL RESULT IN ALL THE EDUCATIONAL SITES THAT ARE RELATED TO SCIKIT LEARN, SIMILARLY YOU CAN USE .com, .in and so on..

searching using synonyms:(did not find it useful as of now though)
if you are not sure of the exact search word or you need to have search results around a topic use '~'
ex:~personality development tricks, ways to ~focus

when you are not sure of the search word in the phrase, you can use "or" or "|" between the words you are confused (useful and apparent)
ex: if you are not sure whether it is jennifer lawrence or jennifer anniston who acted in friends sitcom, you can use
jennifer lawrence | anniston
