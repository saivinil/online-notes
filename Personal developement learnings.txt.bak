superhuman focus:
momentum and inertia are the KEY DETERMINANTS of  CONSISTENT PRODUCTIVITY
to be motivated from within, you just need to remember that YOU ARE GONNA DIE AT SOME POINT, BUT BEFORE YOU DIE YOU SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH YOUR LIFE, NOT REGRETFUL ABOUT IT. (you will be regretful only when you did not spend enough time on things that matter, and you dont spend time on things that matter to you because either you are lazy or you are just not motivated enough)
consistency is the key to successful life
choose solution over distraction- let's say you had a very tough and unexpected huge problem, you are left with only 2 options, either 
1:consciously try to act upon the problem to get a solution or 
2:to distract temporarily from that problem, 
only the first approach can solve the problem(no matter you use the second approach how many times, in the end if you want to get the solution you need to come follow first step, so it is intelligent to chose the first step in the first encounter itself).
the key point to be observed here is, each and everytime you chose one of the above options, it is highly likely that you are going to choose the same option next time when you are going to face a challenging situation and slowly it becomes a habit(Habit is a VERY POWERFUL thing)
the best action that can be taken to above analogy is to start making a conscious effort to choose solutions over distractions
will power is a finite resource, as the will power depletes the ability to stay productive and disciplined,to avoid will power from depletion it is best to stay away from distractions
when you are focused on a task which is important, there might be many distractions (some important and many unimportant(laddu and phone notifications)) to pull you(your focus) out of the task, but only the very highly important distractions should let you come out of your focus, because it takes a lot of time for you to get the focus to start the same task again.
meetings(probably most of the time) are time wasters.
try to become a morning person(wake up at 5 am) by following 2 rules:
	1:sleep whenever you are tired and you feel like you gotta sleep.
	2:wakeup exactly,STRICTLY(no matter what) at 5 or even before.
to achieve your long term goals you have to satisfy the below equation:
	the sum of your actionables each day should contribute to the maximum of your long term vision
write all the things you want to do and check them off when done	
almost everyone have the goal of hitting it high, but ask a honest question to yourself wether are you putting all the hardwork that is needed to hit it high? to have this, you need a great work ethic as there is no shortcut to it.
whenever you have some work to be done, you are left with 2 options
	1:procastinate it
	2:complete it
	let us think you procastinate it, there are 2 negative things to it, the work is left incomplete, and (given that what kind of a person i am) i feel regret(which is the worse thing you can have before you die) that i am just procastinating and wasting time 
	let's think you chose the second choice above and complete the work, you are going to get a positive thing which is a sense of feeling great for the achievement(no matter how small it maybe) for getting things done
	it is now easy to choose  because anyone can choose very easily if they want 2 negative things or 1 positive thing
to avoid procastination, just try to get started, and things carry on in the way of work(MOTIVATION IS A RESULT OF ACTION)

have a DEADLINE and be hard damn on yourself.when you are so hard on your deadlines you will complete it no matter what on or before deadline(allotting more time than it is needed to complete a deadline is same as wasting your time because this approach will never give meaning to the world deadline)

batching up similar tasks will make you more productive as the time you take to adapt to one similar task from another is considerably very low and leads to better productivity

having a to do list is important to know how much you should work, having a DONE LIST will give motivations showing already we have completed much and gives you motivation to do a lot

if you are procastinating things, find the reason of procastination, if it is because of the laziness, just push yourself to start and things start happening. if you are procastinating because of burn out, it is okay to take a considerable break.REMEMBER YOU SHOULD CONTROL THE DURATION OF YOUR BREAK, YOUR BREAK DURATION SHOULD NOT CONTROL YOU.

if you are watching netflix all day just because you have procastinated things, you will feel bad at the end of the day, if you had worked hard with all your focus and sat there at the end of the day to chill on your couch for an episode on netflix, you feel great and get a sense that you actually EARNED it.

ways to get salary incremented:
to get next salary increment rate more(for the next appraisal cycle) than your peers, you need to work from the next day of current uppraisal cycle, for an extra ordinary increment, you dont have any shortcuts, only way is to build your interest to work and keep your efforts without exceptions(smaller or bigger)
salary increment tips are classified in to 3 categories and 7 points(all points from 3 categories):
1:Advance prep methods
2:long term investments
3:Bonus
--
1:Advance prep methods:
(i) data- before you look for increment, you have to make sure that you are not maxed out(getting the highest) in the industry range, checkout platforms like glassdoor,indeed,connect with people on linkedin to see what is the range, include both higher and lower and try to decide what might be the case.
(ii) try understanding the appraisal process:
	get answers to questions like:
		what are the inputs that go in to your company appraisal process?
		how does the process work?
		what hugely impacts the rating process?
		how does the system changed over the years(what are the points that are given importance, which points are removed, try coming to an understanding of , in what direction does the company interest navigate in terms of hike evaluation)
(iii) during self appraisal dont mention what you did, try to mention what did you achieve through what you did, how does your work make the situation better?
2:long term investments:
(i) upskill yourself- world changes everyday, new technologies emerge everyday, new problems come everyday, so it is important for you to keep yourself updated on the every new developement that comes in your line of work.
	-simple logic: in order to get a better appraisal, you need to be better than others, in order to be better,you have to know things better than others and you have to do things better than others, in order to achieve it, i dont think there is a betterway than upskilling yourself
(ii) take responsibility- a company gets profits when it solves the problems of clients, it can be only done when the repsonsibilites of solving the problems are addressed, by executing the idea that will actually solve the problem.so as it is crucial for the companies to accomplish responsibilites	, an individual who puts himself forth to take the responsibilites and try completing them the best way will never ever ever be ignored by the company(99%), even if the employee is ignored there are a lot of companies that are ready to have them aboard
(iii) try to be likeable:
	the more likeable you are, the easier it will be for you to things get done.
	try following these things:
		a:never complain
		b:treat everyone with respect
		c:try to retrospect and understand every useful thing in feedback and do everything you can to change your negative aspects
3:Bonus tip:
	ask what is that you need to do to get to a higher stage
	ask what is that you did not do that got you this result
	ask what went wrong
	ask what went right
	ask what can be better

Super Learner Course:
Lecture 3:
	PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD:
		the novice begins at a comfortable level of muscular intensity and advances towards overload of the muscles over the course of the exercise program. Progressive overload requires a gradual increase in volume, intensity, frequency or time in order to achieve the targeted goal of the user. In this context, volume and intensity are defined as follows:
			Volume is the total number of repetitions multiplied by the resistance (weight) used to perform each repetition.
			Intensity is the percent value of maximal functional capacity, or expressed as percent repetition maximum.
			Frequency is how often a person engages in training activities. Strongly related to training consistency.
			Interval duration is the time in between sets of same exercise or between different exercises.
		This technique results in greater gains in physical strength and muscular growth, but there are limits. An excess of training stimuli can lead to the problem of OVERTRAINING. Overtraining is the decline in training performance over the course of a training program, often accompanied by an increased risk of illness or injury or a decreased desire to exercise. To help avoid this problem, the technique of periodization is applied. PERIODIZATION in the context of fitness or strength training programs means scheduling for adequate recovery time between training sessions, and for variety over the course of a long-term program. Motivation can be maintained by avoiding the MONOTONY of repeating identical exercise routines.
		ex:Through experimentation, the athlete should learn what is the maximum number of repetitions he or she can perform, while maintaining good posture, at a specific weight. For example, if they can do 8 repetitions of the bench press exercise with 50 kg, that will be the baseline. From that point on, the athlete should focus on improving one of the categories mentioned in the methodology section: volume, intensity , frequency, or interval duration. In this example, the athlete could do the same number of repetitions but with 52 kg. Eventually, through the body's natural adaptation process, an increase in strength and muscle mass will allow the subject to continue increasing the weight.
	Pomodoro Technique:
		It’s important to note that a POMODORO IS AN INDIVISIBLE UNIT OF WORK—THAT MEANS IF YOU’RE DISTRACTED PART-WAY BY A COWORKER, MEETING, OR EMERGENCY, YOU EITHER HAVE TO END THE POMODORO THERE (saving your work and starting a new one later), or you have to postpone the distraction until the pomodoro is complete. If you can do the latter, Cirillo suggests the “INFORM, NEGOTIATE AND CALL BACK” STRATEGY:

			INFORM the other (distracting) party that you’re working on something right now.
			NEGOTIATE a time when you can get back to them about the distracting issue in a timely manner.
			SCHEDULE that follow-up immediately.
			CALL back the other party when your Pomodoro is complete and you’re ready to tackle their issue.
		
	how to Avoid Head aches:
		There are many common ideas between going to gym and training your brain. Just like bad practice in gym can cause back aches and orthopaedic damage, bad practice with your brain can cause head aches or eyes strain etc.
		The first thing you should do when training your brain, is resting regularly. Adopt 5 min of rest for every 15 min of work or similar tactics. When resting, close your eyes or look at far landscape. Do not brain-train for more than 2 hours straight, even if you do take the short breaks. Coffee helps, as long as you do not drink too much of it. Make sure you drink a lot of water….
		things needed to be a super learner:
			practice pranayama or deep breathing
			maintain ergonomic posture, healthy diet, good sleep are VERY VERY IMPORTANT
			When practising visualization always try to make funny stuff.  Creative markers are refreshing for your brain and willpower. Do not fixate: try to move quickly from one marker to another. Make the markers highly active in space: they may rotate, get smaller and larger, morph, collide, and do things that cartoon characters do.
			practice saccade reading, more details here (http://www.keytostudy.com/practice-smart-suffer-headaches/#:~:text=By%20far%20the,in%20space%2C%20allow)
			people generally remember:
				10% of what they read
				20% of what they hear
				30% of what they see
				50% of what they hear and see
				70% of what they write and say
				90% of what they do
			IMPORTANT INFERENCES FROM ABOVE NOTE:
				HAVING HANDS ON > WATCHING VIDEO > READING THINGS
			or
				ACTIVE DOING>VISUAL RECIEVING>VERBAL RECIEVING
	the best results in life are often HELD BACK by FALSE CONSTRUCTS and UNTESTED ASSUMPTIONS
	parkinsons law:
		WORK EXPANDS to fill the time allotted for its completion
	FEAR is your friend,fear is an indicator,sometimes it shows what you should not do,more often than not it shows you exactly what you should do
	when you are afraid, just ask yourself, what is the worst that could happen
lecture 7:
two types of memories- 1: working memory, 2:Short term memory
	working memory: the very short term memory, that allows us to interact with and process information.(i.e, listening to complete sentence),greater the working memory capacity, the greater the ability to resist distractions and stay focused on the task at hand.
	short term memory: this keeps the information processed in working memory(discussed above) in the in mind for 15 to 20 seconds
	words,ideas,images and scenes do not use same path to get to short term memory
	long term memory:
lecture 8:
	our brain consists of 100 billion neurons, synapses are specialized connections between neurons
	memories are created when your brain sends nuero transmitter signals to 2 neurons at the same time
	the creation of memories requires connection between 2 nuerons, when this happens repeatedly, a cluster of neurons and synaptic connections from a nueral network, neurons work better when they are in these types of clusters(i.e, when nuerons fire together the signal is amplified), so it is so important to store memories in several connected nuerons and to further connect them to the memories that are often used.
	our brain has 2 hippocampus, each on both right and left hemisphere's, which regulates how memories are created, most impoartant part of hippocampus is to decide what is worth remembering, the more connections that are already existing already in your brain, the more likely hippocampi will determine that the new information is worth storing
	the more connections we make between our memories, the less likely they are to fade away
	ex:you will remember the address you lived in your childhood as you already have numerous instances where you used it or you made some memories over there, therefore your mind as it already have many connections related to this, the mind thinks that this is important information and will store it with out forgetting for a very long period of time.
	SHORT TERM MEMORY(duration around 18 sec)- process of holding not manipulating, short amount of imformation in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time
	ex:used to remember a phone number that has just been recited
	working memory(managing information as you go about your day)-> which refers to structure and process used for temporarily storing and manipulating information
	Chunking
		Chunking is a process by which the memory can be used to remember things in the short term. Chunking is also a process by which a person organizes material into meaningful groups. Although the average person may retain only about four different units in short-term memory, chunking can greatly increase a person's recall capacity. For example, in recalling a phone number, the person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456), and, last, a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering phone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits.
		Practice and the usage of existing information in long-term memory can lead to additional improvements in one's ability to use chunking. In one testing session, an American cross-country runner was able to recall a string of 79 digits after hearing them only once by chunking them into different running times
	The last time you wrote a blog post or article, working memory is what allowed you to hold on to the information you absorbed during your research and then choose what fits best for your piece
	how to optimize your working memory?
	-reduce the stress in your life
		It's a frustrating cycle. Losing focus and not being able to finish a project on time creates stress, which in turn lowers our capacity to regain and maintain focus. One way that has been shown to help us break out of this cycle, however, is to become more MINDFUL.
		When you start to feel unwanted thoughts creep into your head, take a breather and empty your head, even for just a few minutes. It will help you regain your composure and control your focus when you return to your work
	-Exercise More and Stay Fit
		working memory capacity decreased during and immediately after bouts of intense exercise, it increased following a short recovery period when compared to those who hadn't exercised.
		Just like hard exercise is good for increasing your general mental performance, it can specifically boost your working memory capacity as well.
	-Learn New Skills Like Playing an Instrument
		the more we practice a certain skill, the larger the area of the brain activated by that particular type of sensory experience.
		
	- Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits
	-skipping the link from this step: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#:~:text=and%20against%20decay.-,Overcoming%20contamination%20from%20rehearsal,-According%20to%20various)
chapter 10:
	chunking means dividing information in to parts of certain size, the size ranges from 4 (which recent studies suggest, also the credit card numbers are divided in to parts of 4 digits) to 7 plus or minus 2 
	in working memory we can hold 5 chunks, each chunk can healthily store 5 items, so we can store 25 items in working memory
	chunking is the PRIMARY AND THE IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE used by most of the memory athletes.
	Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits(integer has less bits, words or decimals have more bits) but rather in terms of chunks
	A chunk is the largest meaningful unit in the presented material that the person recognizes
	Chunking involves creating something more meaningful—and therefore memorable
	The takeaway is to try to see the connections and make something more meaningful out of the parts you're trying to remember, and practice pattern-recognition to feed your creativity and boost your brain
	chunking:
		 auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does
		 probability of recall of information is greater when the "chunking" strategy is used.
		 Therefore, when "chunking" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.
		 Chunking has been proven to decrease the load on the working memory in many ways. As well as remembering chunked information easier, a person can also recall other non-chunked memories easier due to the benefits chunking has on the working memory
	lecture 13:
		dual coding or brute force learning: when we try to learn an information, try to view it from different perspectives and different useful ways in the same time, in the same way a brute force attack happens at the same time with multiple different passwords/answers
	lecture 15:
	visual memory is simply easier to recall than auditory information, also pictures are more heavily encoded with lots of information
	transform idea,information and other concepts in to imagined visual images
	markers:imaginary pictures or visual representations we use to represent the information we want to remember
	the most memorable visual markers are strange,bizzare and emotionally connected to memories, that means when we try to form an imaginary visual try to make it more exiting to store for our brain by making it bizzare or exciting, so that brain puts extra effort in making the memory more durable
	dual coding theory-> simultaneous processing of visual and audio information, to improve long term memorization and creativity
	a picture is worth thousand words, visualization has more retention power than audio
	next time when you try to remember a name, try adding a lyric to the name, or try visualizing it in the form of an image, each part of the name as symbol
	Mixing colors and music
		Some people go one step further. THEY ARE BORN, OR THEY DEVELOP BY PRACTICE AN ABILITY CALLED SYNESTHESIA. SYNESTHESIA IS A MIX OF SENSES, QUITE OFTEN OF LETTERS OR NUMBERS AND COLORS. People with synesthesia do not just read series of numbers, they see rainbows. THEY DO NOT JUST READ WORDS, THEY SEE SHAPES. HAVING TWO DIFFERENT SENSES ENCODING THE SAME INFORMATION, WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE HOW WE WILL PROCESS IT, tools that are a competitive advantage. THE PROPORTION OF FAMOUS PEOPLE WITH SYNESTHESIA IS EXTREMELY HIGH. A different way to activate both brain parts is available to ambidextrous: if you use one hand to write and another to draw you will discover some strange connections and become more creative. THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDES OF THE BRAIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH IQ AND CREATIVITY, AND QUITE OFTEN WITH GENIUS.
	body memory and gut feeling:
		It is easy to recall something that is AMPLIFIED by the physical and emotional setting
		
	Long-term memorization curse and cure
		All these abilities come handy when we need to remember things for a long period of time, possibly our entire life. WHEN WE NEED TO REMEMBER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS OR MINUTES WE DO NOT NEED DUAL CODING. Any sort of memory sufficiently trained will work, and visual memory will probably work faster. WHEN READING WE CAN DO QUITE WELL WITHOUT DUAL CODING. BUT WHAT WILL WE REMEMBER DAYS AND WEEKS AFTER? IF WE DO NOT UTILIZE DUAL CODING WE WILL HARDLY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THE NEXT DAY. WHEN WE FINISH READING WE PAUSE, AND WE CAN USE THE PAUSE FOR MANY THINGS. ONE OF THEM IS DUAL CODING. EACH SENSE BY ITSELF HAS SOME PROBABILITY TO REMEMBER. THE COMBINED PROBABILITY OF ALL SENSES IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, ALSO DUE TO THE SYNERGY BETWEEN SENSES. THE MORE NEURONS WORK IN UNISON TO REMEMBER SOMETHING, THE STRONGER THAT MEMORY BECOMES. TRAINED MEMORY MASTERS USE THEIR ENTIRE BRAIN TO REMEMBER THINGS: THE VISUALIZATION, THE MUSIC, THE LOGICAL, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONTEXT, THE SUBTLE INTERPLAY BETWEEN VARIOUS SENSES. EACH MEMORY BECOMES RARE AND UNIQUE DUE TO THE EFFORT INVOLVED IN MAKING THE MEMORY MEANINGFUL.
	Dual coding cookbook
		Now let us combine these ideas together into a sort of practical recipe:

		During prereading (previewing the text) notice rare words, names, numbers.
		For each unique object, try to visualize it and also to imagine its sound. To add sound to numbers use mnemonic devices like pegs/PAO/major system.
		WHEN READING, DO NOT JUST VISUALIZE THE MEANING OF THE TEXT, BUT ALSO FEEL THE RHYTHM OF THE TEXT: THE LENGTH OF SENTENCES, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARAGRAPHS, THE MUSIC OF THE WORDS.
		After reading think about what you just read. Maybe you will want to write or draw something. Maybe you will experience a moment of discovery and will want to remember the physical context of it: your body, the room where you sit, the time of the day.
		TRY TO RECALL WHAT YOU JUST READ USING VARIOUS SENSES: RECALL FROM THE VISUALIZATION, RECALL FROM THE AUDIO PERCEPTION, FROM THE PHYSICAL CONTEXT.
		If you have time and persistence, try synaesthesia, breathing or dexterity exercises you can find on this blog.  If you need further ideas, contact me info@keytostudy.com with specific requests.
