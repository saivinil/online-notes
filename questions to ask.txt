mle-gcp:
where is DATASET_DISPLAY_NAME used- an alternative variable used to store dataset in vertex-ai datasets
why is RAW_SCHEMA_DIR used? -> to store schema.pbtxt file
i know why ! is used, why % and %% are used? %-> to execute single line magic command, %%-> to execute block code 
why is it assigned PROJECT == "[your-project-id]":?? 



why do we have vertexai datasets, cloud storage, big query differently, if their purpose is to store data 
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = '/home/...' -># assigning service account key to link big query ,(not coming if we try os.environ with same dev in different tab)
