topics:
1:paper trade
2:indicators:




if you say stock, it can be of any company. if you say shares, it can be related to one company.(in real world,stock represents a quantity, it can be a quantity of single type or many types, whereas share can be of particularly something,it should have a name related to it to have a meaning, for example- I have an 20% share in this RELIANCE MART retail store, 50% share of the profit i get from selling this will be donated to SHARADHA DEVI orphanage , in the both examples you can see reliance mart and sharadha devi orphanage which mean the word share definetly has some relation with a name/company.)

advance-decline ratio: if we consider a set of stocks or index, we can form a ratio of bullishness or bearishness based on the positive and negative moment count of advance decline ratio
advancedecline ratio=no of positive moving stocks/no of negatively moving stocks-> if >1 we can assume the movement of the sector is likely to be positive

each technical indicators will be based on 1:volume,2:price,3: Open Interest
types of indicators:
indicators that generate signal are classified into:
	1:Leading indicators- they generate buy/sell signals ex: fibonacci retracement
	2:lagging indicators- they confirm the trend, ex:Moving average-they confirm either the stock is in bullish or bearish move.
indicators based on position
	1: Overlays- the indicators that lie on top of candle chart (or drawn on to of price movement chart) are overlays. ex: EMA,DMA, Fibonacci retracement
	2:Oscillator- the indicators that lie seperately from candle chart (or drawn on to of price movement chart) are called Oscillators.Ex: MACD,RSI
learn to draw arrows on volume.
if volume is in proportion to the trend(bullish or bearish), more chances that the trend is because of strong reason and is more preferrable than the one with less or no proportion to trend.(in short words, if the stock is moving bullishly and the volume is increasing day by day(or time frame by time frame) then it is most probable that big players or OPERATORS are making this happen)
percentage of stock taken as delivery- (if a 10% stock is taken as delivery by investors, then it means 10% of the stock is bought or sold by someone) let us suppose a stock is fallen by 20% and out of 100% trades happened 60% of the TRADES is taken as delivery, then it means investors sold this stock(as it is fallen by 20%), therefore, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT DELIVERY VOLUME WILL MOST PROBABLY BE IN SUPPORT OF STOCK MOVEMENT.

timings of market:
9 am to 9:15 am- pre market ( all AMO's (after market orders) get settled at this time and if buyers are showing interest to buy shares at a higher price than yesterday's close, then it will open gap up(higher than yesterday's closing price), similarly vicea versa)
9:15 am to 3:30 pm- market hours
3:30 pm to 3:40 pm- this time is used to calculate closing price of the stock and it is calculated on weighted average
3:40 pm to 4:00 pm - post market (pending settlement orders get executed at this time)
4:00 am to 9:00 pm- After market 

GAPS-
1:common gaps- gaps that are formed in range bound, these gaps are not useful for any observation
2:break away gap- this is important gap formation, when a ticker is in rangebound or if it nears resistance, then instead of candle breaking the resistance, if there is a gap up opening,then the base of the gap is treated as an important support and as long as the next candles does not close downside the support formed by the gap, there are chances of reversal and, if the candle closes below the line, then we may have chances of trend reversal
3: run away gap: after a break away gap forms or in a trend, a gap formed without any breaking of support and resistance.
4:exhaustion gap: the gap that will be formed almost after the long run of a trend, which will probably indicate a trend reversal 
we have the need to check candle and volume formations for run away gap and exhaustion gap as they dont really help us form solid observations

this helps to decide wether we should keep SL or trailing SL.


mentalities of market:
bull- optimistic and swings his head upwards
bear- pessimistic and thinks the market should move down like a bear
chicken- unable to take risk and is worried by smallest mishap(like a chicken runs when someone approaches him)
pig- greedy and unable to book profits(similar to a pig that thinks every food should be its even though it can't eat all)
eagle- very accurate and take risk when they think they surely are going to win this.
wolf- thinks to earn by unethical means
ostrich- in times of panic, does not do anything when they make a mistake, thereby making more losses(similar to an ostrich trying to bury its head in ground in times of distress)
sheep- just trying to follow someones opinion blindly similar to a sheep following it's herd blindly
dead cat bounce-similar to a  dead cat which falls from a great height bounces as soon as it hit the ground, there might be a situation where a stock is falling heavily and gives a fake upmove to trap more investors.

price action strategy-
there are 4 stages in price action strategy-
1:price advancing- this phase will see price increase in the stock 
2:price distribution- this stage comes after the price advancing, in this stage, price will be in range bound
3:price declining- this stage will see the price reduction because the bulls are not able to keep up the rally or the absence of positive news may be the reason
4: price accumulation- after price falls in price declining state, the stock will form a base and then the investors feel the stock is under valued and it will have buying and accumulation happens and is more likely to have a rally from then.
*check wyckoff method
pullback or retracement- the process of movement of forming higher lows in an uptrend,lower lows in an downtrend and respecting the trendline, is called pullback or retracement
reversal- the process of breaking the trend(uptrend or down trend) and moving in the opposite direction(downside in an uptrend or upside in down trend) is called reversal

trends concept:
1: what is an uptrend,downtrend or sideways trend? how they are drawn

swing low: the bottom formed in an uptrend or downtrend is called swing low. and generally a swing low point is taken as support/resistance

swing high: the high  formed in an uptrend or downtrend is called swing high.

uptrend: next swing high(or swing low) will always be greater than previous swing high. in simple words trend inwhich higher highs (IMPULSE: the move that is made in the updirection(direction in the favour of the trend) is called impulse) and higher lows (PULLBACK OR RETRACE: the move that is made in down direction (direction that is against the trend) ) are formed is called uptrend(an uptrend in higher lows will be the best option to buy)
downtrend: next swing low(or swing high) will always be lesser than previous swing low. in simeple words trend in which lower highs and lower lows are formed is called downtrend



it is suggested never to sell at higher highs, but is suggested to have an entry position at higher lows.
2:how to draw trendlines and include moving averages in trendlines?
no trendline is PERFECT.  a trendline should have atleast minimum 2 touch points and can have as many as it can. we can consider trendline touching body and wicks as many touch points as it can , when you do draw one line(try drawing support line first), then use "paralell channel" option and then draw line which will have maximum touch points. give more importance to recent swings (touch points formed by recent higher highs and lows)

ema 20- for intraday
ema 48- for swing trading
ema 105- short term
ema 200- goldern standard, long term trend(positive or negative)

trendlines are preferred over ema and ema should give an additional information to trendline
3:how to see trend reversal?
a trend is reversed when the movement is not in the direction of trend.
3.1-in an uptrend try to form a straight line at higher lows(down line or the support line of the trend), the trend reversal is confirmed when we see the trend line breaking the previous higher low(if a horizontal line is drawn at the previous higher low and the candle formation in the trend falls below the horizontalline that is drawn at previous higher low), the candles that are forming while the trend is respected might not be strong, but when a trend is broken, there are higher chances of formation of strong candles which will make the trend reversal look terrible, because the investors who are already following the trend might start panicking
3.2- in a down trend we need to form the line which is respecting the lower highs(i.e, the resistance line or the upper  line), because when ever the upper line is broken, that means there is possibility of trend reversal, when there is a chance of trend reversal, then we have to draw a horizontal line at the previous lower high, and if the candle formation series breaks that line and moves, then there are higher chances that there is a trend reversal, and the horizontal line formed at the previous lower high will act as a suppport.

in both of the above discussed cases when the down line or the upper line that is formed is breaken, then it is better to not to take any new trades as the horizontal line(that is drawn at the previous higher low in uptrend,or the previous lower high line ) is not yet broken, and maintain the nuetral view, the candles that are being formed breaks
(i) the down line or the upper line, then there is more likely to have a previous trend continuation,
(ii) the horizontal line , which conveys that it is more likely to have a trend reversal
4:how to check the trend which is an uptrnd/downtrend in longer time frame, which is reversed in shorter time frames?
suppose there is a uptrend in a weekly time frame and we have noticed a pullback that is being formed from higher high to a higher low. but when whe change timeframe from weekly to daily, then the place where we found a pullback migh actually represent a downtrend, so the timeframe we choose should depend on the choice of the trade or investment we are going to make,for example a weekly timeframe is good for investment purpose,a day timeframe is good for intraday

a good approach of trading the breakage of the trend is to enter the trade with half amount at trend breakage and invest other half after pullback is confirmed(the candle sticks approaching the trend breakage level )
let's suppose that there is a breakage of trend and if the candle that is formed is of large size compared to the existing previous candles then we can understand that we have to be cautious


TIMEFRAMES:
whenever we are using timeframes we have to have 2 time frames for any approach
	1:higher timeframe or trend deciding timeframe-
	this helps us to decide the bulllish trend or bearish trend, after deciding trend we can confirm wether we have to sell or buy
	2:Lower timeframe or trade execution timeframe-
	after deciding wether to buy or sell on higher timeframe(trend deciding timeframe) we have to decide where do we have to place buy/sell and where to keep target and where to keep StopLoss
THESE 2 STEPS DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE HIGHLY IMPORTANT.
monthly- used for long term investing
Trading-
in Trading a checking weekly time once will just give an overview to us,
Trading is classified in to scalping,intraday,swing trade
SCALPING- 
	scalping is the process of keeping the timeframe lowest possible, we have the minimum profit and loss, but having high quantity and more number of trades
	higher timeframe- 5 min
	lower timeframe- 1 min
INTRADAY-
	higher timeframe- 1 hr
	lower timeframe- 15 min
SWING TRADING-
	Here we keep the delivery trade for few days and we wait for move in the direction of our expectation
	higher timeframe- 1 day
	lower timeframe- hourly
positional,longterm-
	positional trade will be for months and longterm will be for years
	higher timeframe- weekly
	lower timeframe- daily
lower timeframe can be higher timeframe/4 or higher timeframe/6	
multi timeframe analysis means analysing and forming an opinion using one or more timeframes, and this multi timeframe analysis should be a top down approach
difference between higher timeframe and lower timeframe:
these 2 are important in their own way
HIGHER TIMEFRAMES have the higher reliability,the resistances and supports in this timeframe are more important than the lower timeframe formed support and resistance.
lower timeframes will have more signals compared to higher timeframe
lower timeframes are suitable for people who have more time and capital to trade and higher timeframe are used for someone who have less time and capital to trade
suppose we have taken a trade in lower timeframe and it is moving in the direction of our expectation, let's suppose that it is nearing a resistance in higher timeframe, now we need to be cautious and
1:if it failed to break resistance, we might have the need to near our stoploss or be cautious on the trade
2:if it successfully broke resistance and sustained there, then we have more probability for the trade to move further in expected direction

slippage: if you want to sell a very large amount of shares, suppose shareprice is visible as 18 rupees, but you can be able to sell at 17.9 the difference of 10 paise is slippage,(also interesting factor is you can't all shares at 17.9 because, as the shares size is too large, you are selling and thereby supply increase and therefore price falls further)
video link-(https://youtu.be/hxUYcgE6WtI)
criteria for stock selection:
should not be in news for a longer time (with multiple or strong negative reasons)
consider value not volume because 1000 shares worth 1 rupee each, 1000 shares with 10,000 each will have same volume but not same value
	for volume-go to link https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/live-equity-market select an index,and sort by value and select top stocks with volume
how control emotions in trading-
you should not loose 1% of total capital in a single trade
	it is better to have clarity on the trade before we take it, because when we have clarity we have idea on 3 things- entry stoploss and target, you can trail stoploss after you reach target.
		
	
1:paper trade:
before doing paper trade- understand the strategy and look for few days, then start paper trade with minimum qty, then gradually get familiarity and then increase the quantity
while doing paper trade, your mind should be as serious as the way it will be, when you trade with real money, this is the best way to succeed in market

trading and investment needs a lot of PRACTICE
2:indicators:
indicators are of 5 types:
trend indicators (shows bullish or bearish trends):
	moving averages,macd,parabolic sar,adx, super trend, vwap
	
momentum indicators(momentum- speed or intensity through which it moves, ex: bank nifty has more momentum compared to nifty)
	rsi,cci,stochastic,mfi,williams %r,aroon
volatalilty indicators (volatality-sudden reversal from the existing trend, if bnifty took 2 hours to move 5% upside and after that in the next 30 minutes, if it moves 5% downside, then it is said to be volatality)
	bollinger bands, atr,donchain channel
volume based
	obv, chaikin,[vwap,mfi]
others
	fibonacci (retracements and extensions), pivot point/cpr(central pivot ranges - 3 ranges are there)

topic moving averages:
video link- https://youtu.be/jZ4edvsiPx0
moving averages are of high importance and with proper knowledge and discipline, you can get profitable and genereate cue's for literally any kind of situation you may face in stock market
1:what is moving average(MA)?
MA for 5 candles = (last 5 candles closing price)/5
we have mentioned as candles not days, because MA is calculated on units of time frame, for example- if we are in hourly time frame, we will take closing price of last 5 hours to calculate the MA of last 5 candles, which is last 5 hours, so unit of time used to calculate average is dependant on the unit of timeframe that we select in the chart
2:how to apply MA on charts?
click on add indicator and type Moving average and select it
when you click on settings in MA on chart, under source you can see different options such as open,close,high,low,hl2,hlc3,ohlc4 this simply means that, which price is to be taken in to consideration for average, is it open or high or close or low. the hl2 stands for (high+low)/2,hlc3-> (high+low+close)/3 ohlc4 -> (open+high+close+low)/4
of all these the close price is taken in to consideration because all the external factors (such as negative news,positive news, high pe,low pe or anything else) will settle at the end of the day. so closing price(unless it is a Lower circuit (LC) or Upper Circuit (UC) which happens very rarely) is something on which all participants of the market agrees
3:what are the types of MA?
3.1- simple moving average: this will simply calculate the average of past n day's price i.e, last n days are treated equally, so the recent price movment is not given priority(which might look as if it is not better for someone who is doing intraday)
3.2- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): this will take last n days for average, but the recent price movements are given most weightage, so that, the moving average reacts and generate signals WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR INTRADAY TRADERS, as EMA is more susceptible to recent prices, there are good chances that it might also be a fake breakout, so to avoid or mitigate this issue, you can use another indicator or trendline or any supporting factor to make signal more clear

4:what is importance of timeframes in MA?
timeframe is an important factor when we are using indicators
for scalping-9ema
for intraday(time frame 15 min)-21 ema
for daily time frame - 21ema,(have a glance and idea purpose (for support and resistance) just check 50,100,200 ema also)
swing trade(time frame 1hr) -48 ema, when it falls below 48, you can exit if you want to, if it is touching the line and is retracing, then you can see that as a buying opportunity
long term/investment - 200 ema(it is always better to buy above 200 day moving average)
5:how to decide and which MA is best?
this may change with time and situations, but above discussed options are best.
6:how to trade with MA?
the direction of MA is importsnt, if it is upside, then it shows that price is MOVING UP and if the candle formation is ABOVE THE LINE, then it is a bullish confirmation, vice a versa is bearish confirmation,
if the candle formations which are above the MA line, comes near the line and again moves up, it is treated as support, vice a versa is resistance
you can also trail if the price movement is slow and gradual the MA line and candle formation will be overlapping, you can wait (if you want) till it moves a considerable distant from the line and then exit

7:how to identify worst trades?
no trading zone: if the price (candle formation) is too far from the line, it is not suggested to take new trades in such situation
8:price action + MA:
in previous videos it has been explained how to identify bullish or bearish trends using higher highs,higher lows and so on... now if there is bullish trend and MA and candle formation is coming up every now and then, each time when the candles are formed upside the MA line, then it isa buy signal, and vice versa for bearish trend
9:disadvantages of MA
9.1 if the scrip is in range bound, stop loss hits frequently
9.2 if there is a gap up or gap down happening 
advantages:
USE MOVING AVERAGE IN HIGHLY TRADED STOCKS
10:conclusion

topic fibonacci retracement: (video link- https://youtu.be/KUVqTH5BX5c)
CONFLUENCE:the scenario in which multiple factors supporting the direction in which we try to take a trade, THE TRADE MIGHT GO WRONG BUT THE QUALITY OF DECISION GETS BETTER.
what is fibonacci?
fibonacci is a series-> 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...
fibonacci retracement and extensions are the ratios that we get by applying logics on fibonacci series
fibonacci is widely represented in nature: ex- sunflower seeds, tornadoes, ear structure and so on and so forth...
important concepts related to it?

how to apply on chart?
we use fibonacci retracement and trend based fibonacci extension(which are available under trendline section in trading view).
fibonacci retracement is always considers values between 0 to 1

fibonacci retracement is applied on chart (only on UPTREND AND DOWNTREND alone) only to get retracement, i.e., to get an idea where the next higher low will be formed in an uptrend or to see the levels when the market highly falls and then tries to retrace

using fibonacci retracement: for set up refer the link with timestamp-https://youtu.be/KUVqTH5BX5c&t=13m50s in an uptrend to know the next higher low(consider the WICK OF THE CANDLE AS WELL) that is going to be formed using fibonacci retracement, then all you need to have is the recent higher high(after which you want to predict where the next higher low is going to be formed) and the higher low (this is the higher low that is formed before the higher high that is discussed previously), select fibonacci retracement and then click on the higher low and then drag it till recent higher high, you can see various lines that are there between recent higher high and the higher low before it, those lines are the critical areas where you can see impulse or trend reversal
vice a versa for bearish trend, 
to put it in simple words, if you want to find the retracement in bearish trend, then the retracement should start from up and end at down i.e, the 100% should be upside(recent impulse starting point and ending point), similarly for bullish trend retracement should start from bottom point and end at the recent high i.e., the 100% should be downside (recent impulse start and end points)

ALL WE WILL BE DOING IS SELECTING 2 POINTS, SELECT FIBONACCI, CLICK ON STARTING POINT OF THE IMPULSE, NEXT, CLICK ON ENDING POINT OF THE IMPULSE. as simple as that

fibonacci should be showing us signs, we should not be taking trading/investment decisions purely based on this., fibonacci should be a contributing factor for confluence(one of the sign that is contributing to our opinion)

among the percentages formed in the fibonacci, the range that is formed between 50% and 61.8% is known as value zone (ALSO KNOWN AS GOLDEN RATIO), buying/selling based on the trend should be preferable here, the area that lies between 38.2%<-> 50% <-> 61.8 is the zone on which we should be focussing

key points in fibonacci retracement:
1: it tries to give us a hint of value zone
2: it tried to show what can be the possible support and resistance zones
3: it just tries to add few points to have our CONFULENCE get better

FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT EXTENSION: 
fibonacci retracement extension will be used to see next all time high or next all time low, because you can not find resistance using normal trendlines as there is no price action movement beyond all time high/low beyond that point
this is similar to fibonacci retracement and in fibonacci retracement you need 2 touch points and in fibonacci extension you need 3 touch points. the third point will be the
