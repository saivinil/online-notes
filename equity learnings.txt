if you say stock, it can be of any company. if you say shares, it can be related to one company.(in real world,stock represents a quantity, it can be a quantity of single type or many types, whereas share can be of particularly something,it should have a name related to it to have a meaning, for example- I have an 20% share in this RELIANCE MART retail store, 50% share of the profit i get from selling this will be donated to SHARADHA DEVI orphanage , in the both examples you can see reliance mart and sharadha devi orphanage which mean the word share definetly has some relation with a name/company.)

advance-decline ratio: if we consider a set of stocks or index, we can form a ratio of bullishness or bearishness based on the positive and negative moment count of advance decline ratio
advancedecline ratio=no of positive moving stocks/no of negatively moving stocks-> if >1 we can assume the movement of the sector is likely to be positive

each technical indicators will be based on 1:volume,2:price,3: Open Interest
types of indicators:
indicators that generate signal are classified into:
	1:Leading indicators- they generate buy/sell signals ex: fibonacci retracement
	2:lagging indicators- they confirm the trend, ex:Moving average-they confirm either the stock is in bullish or bearish move.
indicators based on position
	1: Overlays- the indicators that lie on top of candle chart (or drawn on to of price movement chart) are overlays. ex: EMA,DMA, Fibonacci retracement
	2:Oscillator- the indicators that lie seperately from candle chart (or drawn on to of price movement chart) are called Oscillators.Ex: MACD,RSI
learn to draw arrows on volume.
if volume is in proportion to the trend(bullish or bearish), more chances that the trend is because of strong reason and is more preferrable than the one with less or no proportion to trend.(in short words, if the stock is moving bullishly and the volume is increasing day by day(or time frame by time frame) then it is most probable that big players or OPERATORS are making this happen)
percentage of stock taken as delivery- (if a 10% stock is taken as delivery by investors, then it means 10% of the stock is bought or sold by someone) let us suppose a stock is fallen by 20% and out of 100% trades happened 60% of the TRADES is taken as delivery, then it means investors sold this stock(as it is fallen by 20%), therefore, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT DELIVERY VOLUME WILL MOST PROBABLY BE IN SUPPORT OF STOCK MOVEMENT.

timings of market:
9 am to 9:15 am- pre market ( all AMO's (after market orders) get settled at this time and if buyers are showing interest to buy shares at a higher price than yesterday's close, then it will open gap up(higher than yesterday's closing price), similarly vicea versa)
9:15 am to 3:30 pm- market hours
3:30 pm to 3:40 pm- this time is used to calculate closing price of the stock and it is calculated on weighted average
3:40 pm to 4:00 pm - post market (pending settlement orders get executed at this time)
4:00 am to 9:00 pm- After market 

GAPS-
1:common gaps- gaps that are formed in range bound, these gaps are not useful for any observation
2:break away gap- this is important gap formation, when a ticker is in rangebound or if it nears resistance, then instead of candle breaking the resistance, if there is a gap up opening,then the base of the gap is treated as an important support and as long as the next candles does not close downside the support formed by the gap, there are chances of reversal and, if the candle closes below the line, then we may have chances of trend reversal
3: run away gap: after a break away gap forms or in a trend, a gap formed without any breaking of support and resistance.
4:exhaustion gap: the gap that will be formed almost after the long run of a trend, which will probably indicate a trend reversal 
we have the need to check candle and volume formations for run away gap and exhaustion gap as they dont really help us form solid observations

this helps to decide wether we should keep SL or trailing SL.


mentalities of market:
bull- optimistic and swings his head upwards
bear- pessimistic and thinks the market should move down like a bear
chicken- unable to take risk and is worried by smallest mishap(like a chicken runs when someone approaches him)
pig- greedy and unable to book profits(similar to a pig that thinks every food should be its even though it can't eat all)
eagle- very accurate and take risk when they think they surely are going to win this.
wolf- thinks to earn by unethical means
ostrich- in times of panic, does not do anything when they make a mistake, thereby making more losses(similar to an ostrich trying to bury its head in ground in times of distress)
sheep- just trying to follow someones opinion blindly similar to a sheep following it's herd blindly
dead cat bounce-similar to a  dead cat which falls from a great height bounces as soon as it hit the ground, there might be a situation where a stock is falling heavily and gives a fake upmove to trap more investors.

price action strategy-
there are 4 stages in price action strategy-
1:price advancing- this phase will see price increase in the stock 
2:price distribution- this stage comes after the price advancing, in this stage, price will be in range bound
3:price declining- this stage will see the price reduction because the bulls are not able to keep up the rally or the absence of positive news may be the reason
4: price accumulation- after price falls in price declining state, the stock will form a base and then the investors feel the stock is under valued and it will have buying and accumulation happens and is more likely to have a rally from then.
*check wyckoff method
pullback or retracement- the process of movement of forming higher lows in an uptrend,lower lows in an downtrend and respecting the trendline, is called pullback or retracement
reversal- the process of breaking the trend(uptrend or down trend) and moving in the opposite direction(downside in an uptrend or upside in down trend) is called reversal

trends concept:
1: what is an uptrend,downtrend or sideways trend? how they are drawn

swing low: the bottom formed in an uptrend or downtrend is called swing low. and generally a swing low point is taken as support/resistance

swing high: the high  formed in an uptrend or downtrend is called swing high.

uptrend: next swing high(or swing low) will always be greater than previous swing high. in simple words trend inwhich higher highs and higher lows are formed is called uptrend(an uptrend in higher lows will be the best option to buy)
downtrend: next swing low(or swing high) will always be lesser than previous swing low. in simeple words trend in which lower highs and lower lows are formed is called downtrend



it is suggested never to sell at higher highs, but is suggested to have an entry position at higher lows.
2:how to draw trendlines and include moving averages in trendlines?
no trendline is PERFECT.  a trendline should have atleast minimum 2 touch points and can have as many as it can. we can consider trendline touching body and wicks as many touch points as it can , when you do draw one line(try drawing support line first), then use "paralell channel" option and then draw line which will have maximum touch points. give more importance to recent swings (touch points formed by recent higher highs and lows)

ema 20- for intraday
ema 48- for swing trading
ema 105- short term
ema 200- goldern standard, long term trend(positive or negative)

trendlines are preferred over ema and ema should give an additional information to trendline
3:how to see trend reversal?
a trend is reversed when the movement is not in the direction of trend.
3.1-in an uptrend try to form a straight line at higher lows(down line or the support line of the trend), the trend reversal is confirmed when we see the trend line breaking the previous higher low(if a horizontal line is drawn at the previous higher low and the candle formation in the trend falls below the horizontalline that is drawn at previous higher low), the candles that are forming while the trend is respected might not be strong, but when a trend is broken, there are higher chances of formation of strong candles which will make the trend reversal look terrible, because the investors who are already following the trend might start panicking
3.2- in a down trend we need to form the line which is respecting the lower highs(i.e, the resistance line or the upper  line), because when ever the upper line is broken, that means there is possibility of trend reversal, when there is a chance of trend reversal, then we have to draw a horizontal line at the previous lower high, and if the candle formation series breaks that line and moves, then there are higher chances that there is a trend reversal, and the horizontal line formed at the previous lower high will act as a suppport.

in both of the above discussed cases when the down line or the upper line that is formed is breaken, then it is better to not to take any new trades as the horizontal line(that is drawn at the previous higher low in uptrend,or the previous lower high line ) is not yet broken, and maintain the nuetral view, the candles that are being formed breaks
(i) the down line or the upper line, then there is more likely to have a previous trend continuation,
(ii) the horizontal line , which conveys that it is more likely to have a trend reversal
4:how to check the trend which is an uptrnd/downtrend in longer time frame, which is reversed in shorter time frames?
suppose there is a uptrend in a weekly time frame and we have noticed a pullback that is being formed from higher high to a higher low. but when whe change timeframe from weekly to daily, then the place where we found a pullback migh actually represent a downtrend, so the timeframe we choose should depend on the choice of the trade or investment we are going to make,for example a weekly timeframe is good for investment purpose,a day timeframe is good for intraday

a good approach of trading the breakage of the trend is to enter the trade with half amount at trend breakage and invest other half after pullback is confirmed(the candle sticks approaching the trend breakage level )
let's suppose that there is a breakage of trend and if the candle that is formed is of large size compared to the existing previous candles then we can understand that we have to be cautious


TIMEFRAMES:
whenever we are using timeframes we have to have 2 time frames for any approach
	1:higher timeframe or trend deciding timeframe-
	this helps us to decide the bulllish trend or bearish trend, after deciding trend we can confirm wether we have to sell or buy
	2:Lower timeframe or trade execution timeframe-
	after deciding wether to buy or sell on higher timeframe(trend deciding timeframe) we have to decide where do we have to place buy/sell and where to keep target and where to keep StopLoss
THESE 2 STEPS DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE HIGHLY IMPORTANT.
monthly- used for long term investing
Trading-
in Trading a checking weekly time once will just give an overview to us,
Trading is classified in to scalping,intraday,swing trade
SCALPING- 
	scalping is the process of keeping the timeframe lowest possible, we have the minimum profit and loss, but having high quantity and more number of trades
	higher timeframe- 5 min
	lower timeframe- 1 min
INTRADAY-
	higher timeframe- 1 hr
	lower timeframe- 15 min
SWING TRADING-
	Here we keep the delivery trade for few days and we wait for move in the direction of our expectation
	higher timeframe- 1 day
	lower timeframe- hourly
positional,longterm-
	positional trade will be for months and longterm will be for years
	higher timeframe- weekly
	lower timeframe- daily
lower timeframe can be higher timeframe/4 or higher timeframe/6	
multi timeframe analysis means analysing and forming an opinion using one or more timeframes, and this multi timeframe analysis should be a top down approach
difference between higher timeframe and lower timeframe:
these 2 are important in their own way
HIGHER TIMEFRAMES have the higher reliability,the resistances and supports in this timeframe are more important than the lower timeframe formed support and resistance.
lower timeframes will have more signals compared to higher timeframe
lower timeframes are suitable for people who have more time and capital to trade and higher timeframe are used for someone who have less time and capital to trade
suppose we have taken a trade in lower timeframe and it is moving in the direction of our expectation, let's suppose that it is nearing a resistance in higher timeframe, now we need to be cautious and
1:if it failed to break resistance, we might have the need to near our stoploss or be cautious on the trade
2:if it successfully broke resistance and sustained there, then we have more probability for the trade to move further in expected direction

slippage: if you want to sell a very large amount of shares, suppose shareprice is visible as 18 rupees, but you can be able to sell at 17.9 the difference of 10 paise is slippage,(also interesting factor is you can't all shares at 17.9 because, as the shares size is too large, you are selling and thereby supply increase and therefore price falls further)
video link-(https://youtu.be/hxUYcgE6WtI)
criteria for stock selection:
should not be in news for a longer time (with multiple or strong negative reasons)
consider value not volume because 1000 shares worth 1 rupee each, 1000 shares with 10,000 each will have same volume but not same value
	for volume-go to link https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/live-equity-market select an index,and sort by value and select top stocks with volume
how control emotions in trading-
you should not loose 1% of total capital in a single trade
	it is better to have clarity on the trade before we take it, because when we have clarity we have idea on 3 things- entry stoploss and target, you can trail stoploss after you reach target.
