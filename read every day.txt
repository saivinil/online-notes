FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE AND JUST FOCUS ON WHATEVER YOU ARE GOING TO READ BELOW

1:read shloka- “Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana,Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhur Ma Te Sango Stv Akarmani”
meaning- You have every right to work but not expecting the fruits out of it.Let the focus be not on the fruits and never be inactive.

have a tinge of EXCITEMENT and HAPPINESS (especially the happiness you get after solving a task successfully should be there WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE TASK), while you are working.

isnt it exciting to have laptop with you and knowing multiple things while working or learning a new technology

BE COMPOSED, ALMOST EVERYTIME, THE PERSON WHO GETS SUCCEDED IN THE CAREER IS WHEN HE/SHE IS CALM, COMPOSED, EXCITED TO LEARN, THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTH AND WELLBEING,  ALMOST VERY RARE AND NEGLIGIBLE CASES ARE THERE WHERE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT COMPOSED WILL BECOME SUCCESSFUL, BUT HEALTH AND WELLBEING WILL BE IN THE FIRST CASE, NOT IN THIS CASE, CHOOSE WHICH CASE YOU THINK IS GOOD

there will be scenario in everyday where you start using phone(CLOSE YOUR EYES AND UNDERSTAND THE FOMO MOMENTS WHICH ARE TRIVIAL IN REALITY), because of a feeling that you have done a lot today and you go on use it and disturb the sync that you are in, good thing is to divert that work towards progressive work which will help your career, KEEP YOUR PHONE USAGE MINIMAL

you should try to be calm and performing well, the only thing that can aid you in performing well is- learning and practicing now WITH UTMOST DEDICATION, REMEMBER THE MORE YOU SWEAT IN PRACTICE, THE LESS YOU BLEED IN BATTLE.

as you are practicing now with all effort and FOCUS if you put the FOCUS in a progressive overloading manner to complete the course, that is the whole thing that matters and you may not have the need to be frightened,

you got a good and precious chance, be composed and happy by it, IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE GET CHANCE LIKE THIS? NOT EVEN 1 IN TEN THOUSAND!!!, in fact, if you understand truly, this is the chance to be happy and to be a great person and help the world. this is an advantage that you need to accept with both hands.

The company is believing in me, I have to do JUSTICE to every penny it is paying me,

try to be composed,if you are not able to be composed,ask yourself what is the reason behind it, if there is no reason, then let your deep self understand that you can be hardworking and composed.

Remember you have a loving family, food to eat, clothes to wear,place to live, you should be privileged and very eager and EXCITED to work, be peaceful.

moreover senganal had provided a lot of time for me to learn, he and this company had given me a lot, I already started repaying the company and will continue to do so

in the past few days, you are behaving as if, during workdays also it is your right to just have 14 to 15 pomodors and just use phone and relax, just ask yourself whether this is the way you want to be

time calculation:
15 pomodoros = 2 hours of udemy (first observation, not totally perfect, just for reference)
7 pomodoros = 44 minuts of udemy 15/5/22

24 hours-
8hrs sleep
1 hr exercise
2 hr bath,eat
2 hr misc work
1 hr phone
10 hr work time

total average time to be spent 150 hours

day1 -3hrs
day2 -15 pomodoros - 7 hours (not 10 hours, you need to improve a lot to achieve what you have promised yourself)
day3 -1hr + 12 pomodoros - 14 pomodoros - 7hrs (not 10 hours, you need to improve a lot to achieve what you have promised yourself)
day4  - 10 pomodoros - 5 hours - (not estimated 10 hours, exactly half the time less than you were supposed to, this is not what you have promised to yourself)
day5 - 9min + 14 pomodoros - 7 hours (need to fasten up, you should know that you aretaking it on a relaxed phase, it should not be the case, remember what you had promised your self)
day6 - 12 pomodors- (konchamaina siggundha ra niku... 10000 lo okadiki vache opportunity nikosthe ila use chesthara evaraina?)
day7 - 0 pomodoros - (no words assalu)
day8 - 0 pomodoros - (nuvem alochisthunnavo telsa, nu ni goal achieve avvakapoina relax authunnay, nu ni shlokanni assal patinchatla, this will change from now)
day9 - 12 pomodoros - (not the performance you wanted)
day10 - 18 pomodoros (highest performance till date, take a moment to appreciate it, but this is not the performance you wanted)
day12 - 10 pomodoros (try to be calm, composed and peaceful, try to understand the situation, pressure comes when you dont have the right understanding, take a step back, breath , think and then act)
day13 - 16 pomodoros (you are becoming reluctant sometimes, you are behaving as if you badly deserve a break to spend time with phone, genuinely you are not that kind of guy, you might have to think about it again after few days)
day-14 - 12 pomodoros (you need to think why are you taking frequent short breaks)
day 15- 15 pomodoros (good number, but attitude change needed)
day 16-1/6 - 11 pomodors (when you are trying to do work by force, just take a step back and think again, what is it that is stopping from you to work?)
day 17- 2/6 - 9 pomodoros (you are gonna set everything straight and work hard and actively)
day 18- 3/6 - 6 pomodoros 
day 19-4/6 - sat - 4 pomodoros
day 20-5/6 - sun - 2 pomodoros
day 21-6/6 - 10 pomodoros
day 22-7/6 - 12 pomodoros (behind by 167 pomodoros)
day 23-8/6 - 4 pomodoros  (behind by 181 pomodoros, be composed and think wether you want to be successful? if yes try to take steps in the direction of reducing the pomodoro estimated gap)
day 24- 9/6 - 3 pomodoros (behind by 197 pomodoros)
day 25- 13/6 - 8 pomodoros (behind by 207 pomodoros)
day 26- 14/6 - 12 pomodoros (behind by 213 pomodoros)
day 27- 15/6 - 12 pomodoros (behind by 219 pomodoros, the struggle you had in the end for the 12th pomodoro is worth applaud, because at that pomodoro you thought you were exhausted, but after that you decided you want to learn and then you spent last pomodoro with full focus, it is good to have that attitude, develop it with you)


just because the time is 10:30 you think you were exhausted and not interested in work, is it the right type of attitude?
yes or no?
