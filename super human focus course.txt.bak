momentum and inertia are the KEY DETERMINANTS of  CONSISTENT PRODUCTIVITY
to be motivated from within, you just need to remember that YOU ARE GONNA DIE AT SOME POINT, BUT BEFORE YOU DIE YOU SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH YOUR LIFE, NOT REGRETFUL ABOUT IT. (you will be regretful only when you did not spend enough time on things that matter, and you dont spend time on things that matter to you because either you are lazy or you are just not motivated enough)
consistency is the key to successful life
choose solution over distraction- let's say you had a very tough and unexpected huge problem, you are left with only 2 options, either 
1:consciously try to act upon the problem to get a solution or 
2:to distract temporarily from that problem, 
only the first approach can solve the problem.
the key point to be observed here is, each and everytime you chose one of the above options, it is highly likely that you are going to choose the same option next time when you are going to face a challenging situation and slowly it becomes a habit(Habit is a very powerful thing)
the best action that can be taken to above analogy is to start making a conscious effort to choose solutions over distractions
will power is a finite resource, as the will power depletes the ability to stay productive and disciplined depletes,to avoid will power from depletion it is best to stay away from distractions
when you are focused on a task which is important, there might be many distractions (some important and many unimportant(laddu and phone notifications)) to pull you(your focus) out of the task, but only the very highly important distractions should let you come out of your focus, because it takes a lot of time for you to get the focus to start the same task again.
meetings(probably most of the time) are time wasters.
try to become a morning person(wake up at 5 am) by following 2 rules:
	1:sleep whenever you are tired and you feel like you gotta sleep.
	2:wakeup exactly at 5 or even before.
to achieve your long term goals you have to satisfy the below equation:
	the sum of your actionables each day should contribute to the maximum of your long term vision
write all the things you want to do and check them off when done	
almost everyone have the goal of hitting it high, but ask a honest question to yourself wether are you putting all the hardwork that is needed to hit it high? to have this, you need a great work ethic as there is no shortcut to it.
whenever you have some work to be done, you are left with 2 options
	1:procastinate it
	2:complete it
	let us think you procastinate it, there are 2 negative things to it, the work is left incomplete, and (given that what kind of a person i am) i feel regret(which is the worse thing you can have before you die) that i am just procastinating and wasting time 
	let's think you chose the second choice above and complete the work, you are going to get a positive thing which is a sense of feeling great for the achievement(no matter how small it maybe) for getting things done
	it is now easy to choose  because anyone can choose very easily if they want 2 negative things or 1 positive thing
to avoid procastination, just try to get started, and things carry on in the way of work(MOTIVATION IS A RESULT OF ACTION)

have a DEADLINE and be hard damn on yourself.when you are so hard on your deadlines you will complete it no matter what on or before deadline(allotting more time than it is needed to complete a deadline is same as wasting your time because this approach will never give meaning to the world deadline)

batching up similar tasks will make you more productive as the time you take to adapt to one similar task from another is considerably very low and leads to better productivity

having a to do list is important to know how much you should work, having a DONE LIST will give motivations showing already we have completed much and gives you motivation to do a lot
